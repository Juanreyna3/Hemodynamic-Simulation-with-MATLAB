%equations that model the flow in the converging section
 
%{
from the assumption that the flow is steady, the derivatives of the 
equations that define the flow with respect to time ('du/dt'and 'dv/dt') 
must have a sum of zero. 
from this, the constants 'a' and 'b' were calculated to have 
the ratio of 1:2.8333. So, when 'a' obtains the value of 10, 
'b' correspondingly receives the value of 28.333.

the coordinates are taken to match the given dimensions of the 
blood vessel geometry (10cm in length and 1.5 cm radii)
 
the 'x' values are said to corresponding to the values of length while the 
'y' values correspond to the varying radii lengths (distance from the 
middle of the cross-sectional area of the converging cylinder)
