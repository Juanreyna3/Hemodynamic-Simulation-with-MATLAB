%%finding the location of the stagnant point in flow field%%
% stagnant point is when velocity equals zero V= u+v where 
% u and v equal zero
syms x y % creates variables x and y 
u=0; % defines the value of u as zero 
v=0; % defines value of v as zero 
% u and v = 0 due to lagrangian equation for velocity: V = ui+vj=0 
u= 0.5 + 0.8*x; % defines equation for u and x
v = 1.5 - 0.8*y; % defines equation for v and y 
% find the values for x and y 
X=solve(u,x); % solves equation u for variable x in fraction form
Y=solve(v,y); % solves equation v for variable y in fraction form
% displays solution as a string with values as decimals instead of fractions 
stangnant_point =sprintf('x= %.15gm and y=%.15gm',X, Y)
